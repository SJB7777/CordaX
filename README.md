# PAL-XFEL Data Analysis Toolkit

## Project Overview
The **PAL-XFEL Data Analysis Toolkit** is a specialized suite of tools developed for the efficient processing and analysis of PAL-XFEL data, with a focus on studying polaronic lattice distortions in Strontium Titanate (STO) nanocrystals. This toolkit is designed to enhance data handling, reduce processing times, and ensure the integrity of analytical results, making it an essential asset for our research on perovskite-oxide materials.

## Goals
- **Efficient Data Management**: Utilize HDF5 for structured storage and rapid data access.
- **Accelerated Data Processing**: Implement parallel processing techniques to speed up I/O operations.
- **Data Quality Assurance**: Apply preprocessing methods to clean and standardize data for reliable analysis.
- **Automated Workflows**: Develop Python scripts to automate the data processing pipeline, from raw data to analytical outputs.

## Key Components
- **HDF5 Integration**: For organizing and managing large datasets.
- **Parallel Processing**: To handle data-intensive tasks more efficiently.
- **Preprocessing Algorithms**: To remove anomalies and normalize data.
- **Python Scripts**: For automating data workflows and analysis.

## Future Enhancements
- **Scalability**: Continue to optimize the toolkit to handle increasing data volumes.
- **Adaptability**: Ensure the tools can be adapted to various research needs.
- **Collaboration**: Share insights and tools within our research community to foster collective progress.

## Getting Involved
This toolkit is primarily for internal use within our research group, but we welcome feedback and suggestions from our colleagues. Please reach out if you have ideas or wish to contribute to our ongoing development.
